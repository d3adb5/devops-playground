# DevOps Playground

This is a repository for testing, learning and playing around with DevOps tools
and technologies.

This repository has multiple root commits, as different parts of it came from
other repositories. This is done to preserve the history of the original
repositories instead of essentially squashing them into a single commit added to
this repository.

Each subdirectory in this repository is dedicated to a specific topic: a tool, a
concept, a deployment strategy, etc. They should each have their own `README.md`
file with more information about its contents.

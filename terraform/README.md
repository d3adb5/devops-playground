# Terraform Playground

This is a simple Terraform playground to test out Terraform configurations,
modules, and providers. The configuration in this repository won't be used for
real infrastructure, by which I mean there won't be CD pipelines deploying these
to PaaS / IaaS providers. They might be used locally, but not in "production".
